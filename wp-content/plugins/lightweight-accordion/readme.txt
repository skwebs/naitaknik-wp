Extremely simple accordion for adding collapse elements to pages without affecting page load time. Works for Classic Editor via shortcode and Gutenberg via Block.

== Description ==

**Lightweight Accordion** plugin for WordPress allows you to add collapse elements to posts using a **Gutenberg block** or a **shortcode** (via classic editor). By using the details HTML tag and a few lines of CSS this allows for a javascript-free accordion for minimum page load.

**Extremely Lightweight (<1kb):** Without using Javascript the plugin uses the native details HTML tag and a few lines of code for almost no impact on front-end.

**Customizable:** Options include customizing the HTML tag used for the accordion title, open by default, orders, and colors.

= Shortcode Usage examples =

Here are a few examples of using the accordion plugin with shortcodes.

`[lightweight-accordion title="My Accordion"]My Content[/lightweight-accordion]`

Additionally you can display the accordion open on load with the accordion_open option.

`[lightweight-accordion title="My Accordion" accordion_open=true]My Content[/lightweight-accordion]`

You can also change the html tag wrapping the title of the accordion using the title_tag option.

`[lightweight-accordion title="My Accordion" title_tag="h3"]My Content[/lightweight-accordion]`

If you want to include FAQ schema you can add the schema option and set it to faq.

`[lightweight-accordion title="What is your return policy?" schema="faq"]You have 1 week to return your items[/lightweight-accordion]`

If you'd like put a border around the content of the accordion you can use the "bordered" attribute.

`[lightweight-accordion title="Bordered Content" bordered=true]My Content[/lightweight-accordion]`

= Shortcode Options =

Here is the full listing of shortcode options. Additionally all of these options are accessible when using the Gutenberg block.

* **title** (Required Default: null) The title of your accordion will be displayed at the top for users to click. A good example would be to include a user's question so they could click it for more details.
* **content** (Required Default: null) Content that will go into your accordion element.
* **title_tag** (Default: "span") This sets the html tag that wraps the title in the accordion summary. Useful if you want to make it a heading tag for SEO purposes.
* **accordion_open** (Default: false) Set this to true if you want your accordion to be open by default.
* **bordered** (Default: false) Set this to true if you want a border around the accordion content.
* **title_text_color** (Default: false) Set this to a hex value or CSS color to change the color of the accordion title text.
* **title_background** (Default: false) Set this to a hex value or CSS color to change the color of the accordion title text.
* **schema** (Default: false) Set this to faq if you'd like FAQ schema to be included.
* **class** (Default: false) Used to add a custom class to the parent container of the accordion.
* **anchor** (Default: null) Adds the value as an ID to the accordion div as an anchor.
